# Event-Extraction-and-Summarization

With the growth of digital media, articles and news who has the time to go through the entire articles and news? This volume of text is an invaluable source of information and knowledge which needs to be effectively represented and summarized. Therefore, we propose to design and implement an efficient as well as an easy to use event extraction and summarization mechanism. Our system design ensures to provide detailed information about the events related to political violence and riots, making it possible for the user to gain meaningful insights regarding the event just by skimming through the summary by ingesting news articles. 
System generates following information for each event: event date, event location, event type, parties involved, data sources and a brief description. The event types which we have focused on are Riots, Protests and Violence against civilians. A list of countries for which we are performing the task of violence activity detection and summarization are India, Indonesia, Thailand. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the system.
